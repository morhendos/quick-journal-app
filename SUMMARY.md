# Development Summary

## Authentication Implementation (In Progress)

### Current Status
Working on implementing basic authentication with NextAuth v5 in the quick-journal-app. Currently encountering 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors on the /api/auth/session endpoint.

### What's Been Done
1. Added authentication dependencies:
   - next-auth (v5 beta)
   - @auth/core
   - zod for validation

2. Created basic authentication structure:
   - Login page component with form
   - Auth configuration in src/lib/auth/config.ts
   - Auth API routes
   - Protected routes via middleware
   - Basic session handling

3. Attempted several approaches to fix session handling:
   - Tried separate session route handler
   - Tried combining handlers
   - Tried different middleware configurations
   - Updated cookie settings

### Current Issues
1. Main error: 405 (Method Not Allowed) on /api/auth/session
   - This indicates the GET method isn't properly handled for the session endpoint
   - Previous attempts to fix this haven't resolved the issue
   - Error appears consistently in the console

### Test Credentials
- Email: user@example.com
- Password: password123

### Next Steps
1. Research specific NextAuth v5 session handling requirements
2. Consider implementing a simpler auth configuration first:
   - Remove custom session handling initially
   - Start with basic credentials provider only
   - Add session complexity gradually
3. Check NextAuth v5 documentation for any specific beta version requirements
4. Consider implementing server-side session handling as an alternative approach

### Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 14.1.0
- Project uses app router structure
- Current implementation attempts to handle both client and server-side authentication
- Need to maintain existing project structure (TypeScript, tailwind, etc.)

### Environment Requirements
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Branch Information
- Working on branch: feature/auth-implementation
- All authentication changes are isolated to this branch
- Main application functionality remains unchanged on main branch
