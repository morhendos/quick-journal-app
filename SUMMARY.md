# Development Summary

## Authentication Implementation (In Progress)

### Current Status
Working on implementing basic authentication with NextAuth v5 in the quick-journal-app. Currently encountering multiple errors:

1. Middleware Error:
```typescript
⨯ (0 , *lib*auth_config__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.auth) is not a function
  1 | import { auth } from "@/lib/auth/config";
  2 |
> 3 | export default auth((req) => {
```
This indicates our auth configuration export is incorrect - auth is not being exported as a function as middleware expects.

2. Session Endpoint Error:
405 (Method Not Allowed) on /api/auth/session - This error appears after the middleware error is resolved.

### What's Been Done
1. Added authentication dependencies:
   - next-auth (v5 beta)
   - @auth/core
   - zod for validation

2. Created basic authentication structure:
   - Login page component with form
   - Auth configuration in src/lib/auth/config.ts
   - Auth API routes
   - Protected routes via middleware
   - Basic session handling

3. Attempted several approaches to fix session handling:
   - Tried separate session route handler
   - Tried combining handlers
   - Tried different middleware configurations
   - Updated cookie settings

### Critical Issues to Fix
1. Middleware Function Error:
   - Current auth export in config.ts is not compatible with middleware usage
   - Need to ensure auth is exported as a function that can be used as middleware
   - This is blocking the application from even starting properly

2. Session Handling:
   - Once middleware is fixed, need to address session endpoint 405 error
   - Session configuration might need to be adjusted

### Next Steps
1. Fix auth export in config.ts:
   - Ensure it exports a function compatible with Next.js middleware
   - Review NextAuth v5 docs specifically about middleware implementation
   - Consider simplifying auth configuration to minimal working version first

2. After middleware is fixed:
   - Address session endpoint issues
   - Implement proper session handling
   - Test full authentication flow

### Test Credentials
- Email: user@example.com
- Password: password123

### Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 14.1.0
- Project uses app router structure
- Next-auth v5 beta has different middleware requirements than v4
- Need to maintain existing project structure (TypeScript, tailwind, etc.)

### Environment Requirements
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Branch Information
- Working on branch: feature/auth-implementation
- All authentication changes are isolated to this branch
- Main application functionality remains unchanged on main branch

### Current File Structure
Key files that need attention:
```

  ├── lib/
  │   └── auth/
  │       └── config.ts       # Needs fixing - auth export issue
  ├── middleware.ts           # Using auth as middleware - failing
