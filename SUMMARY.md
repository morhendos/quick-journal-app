# Quick Journal App - Authentication Issue Summary

## Current State

### Authentication Flow Status
- Login page works but doesn't complete the authentication flow
- After login attempt, user is stuck at `/login?callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/`
- Session is not being properly maintained/created

### Console Logs
```javascript
Current session: null
Auth status: unauthenticated
Attempting sign in with: Object
Sign in result: Object
Sign in successful
```

### Terminal Errors
```
Attempted import error: 'authOptions' is not exported from './api/auth/[...nextauth]/route'
```

### File Structure
Key authentication files:
1. `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Main auth configuration
2. `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API route
3. `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with SessionProvider
4. `/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page implementation
5. `/src/app/providers.tsx` - NextAuth provider wrapper

### Recent Changes
- Removed duplicate NextAuth initializations
- Consolidated auth configuration in `/src/lib/auth.ts`
- Updated session handling in root layout
- Added debug logging throughout auth flow

## Known Issues
1. Import error in layout.tsx (authOptions not found)
2. Session not being created after successful credential validation
3. Redirect not working after successful authentication

## Environment Setup
- Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- TypeScript implementation
- Environment variables required:
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
  - NEXTAUTH_URL

## Test Credentials
- Email: user@example.com
- Password: password123

## Next Steps
1. Fix authOptions import in layout.tsx
2. Verify session token creation in JWT callback
3. Debug session persistence issue
4. Fix redirect after successful authentication

## Important Notes
- All auth initializations consolidated to avoid duplicates
- Using JWT strategy for session handling
- Debug mode is enabled for detailed logging
- Browser cache/cookies should be cleared for testing
