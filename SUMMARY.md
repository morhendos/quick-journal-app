# Quick Journal App - Authentication Issue Summary

## Current State

### Authentication Flow Status

- Login page works but doesn't complete the authentication flow
- After login attempt, user is stuck at
  `/login?callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/`

### File Structure

Key authentication files:

1. `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Main auth configuration
2. `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API route
3. `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with SessionProvider
4. `/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page implementation
5. `/src/app/providers.tsx` - NextAuth provider wrapper

### Recent Changes

- Removed duplicate NextAuth initializations
- Consolidated auth configuration in `/src/lib/auth.ts`
- Updated session handling in root layout
- Added debug logging throughout auth flow

## Known Issues

What's interesting here is that while we get a successful auth result
(`ok: true`), we're not seeing ANY of our custom logs from the auth callbacks in
`auth.ts`.

When the auth flow works correctly, we should see logs from:

1. The authorize callback when checking credentials
2. The jwt callback when creating the token
3. The session callback when setting up the session

But we're not seeing any of these, which suggests our auth configuration might
not be getting used.

Let's verify which auth configuration is actually being used. Can you check the
Network tab in your browser's dev tools when you click sign in? We should see
requests to:

1. `/api/auth/csrf`
2. `/api/auth/signin`
3. `/api/auth/session`

This will help us confirm which endpoints are being hit and with what
configuration.

Also, the `DEBUG_ENABLED` warning suggests NextAuth's debug mode is on, but
we're not seeing any debug logs, which is suspicious.

## Environment Setup

- Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- TypeScript implementation
- Environment variables required:
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
  - NEXTAUTH_URL

## Test Credentials

- Email: user@example.com
- Password: password123
